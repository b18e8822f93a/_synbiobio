			<p class='card-text'>Whilst undertaking analyst engagements we've been getting quite familiar with the industry, how it's shaping up and some of the key players and we think it's worth sharing some of the those insights through a database and website for those interested in the industry and how the landscape of interconnected companies is emerging.<br/><br/>At this point in the development of the industry it seems quite unclear, to us at least, how it may mature over time. Understanding how this industry may adopt and tweak comparative business models such as app store economics, cloud offerings and foundry services or how it may overcome it's unique challenge through innovation and collaboration is definitely a story we look forward to understanding and sharing.<br/><br/>Although fundamentally this is a database listing companies, recording the products, services and connections in doing so will inevitably outline the technology, science and computing that are being applied to facilitate the progression and adoption of the industry.</p>
