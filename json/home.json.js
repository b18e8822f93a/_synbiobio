<p>Synthetic biology, there’s never really been a discipline quite like it, it can’t help but fill you with you inspiration; engineering, science, computing, robotics, AI, entrepreneurship, a chance to work within a truly motivated community, a technology that can make an impact on some of our greatest challenges, scope to build a breath of products that is difficult to currently envisage and unprecedented opportunity to build businesses providing real value and wealth creation.
</p><p>The replacement of existing industrial processes can have direct consequences on environmental and ecological harms, energy consumption and human and animal welfare.
</p><p>So for sure it’s exciting, opportunity is abundant, but biology is difficult, evolution, the central dogma has implications for engineered microbes, whether those in fermentation tanks or deployed out to the field. Ideas also need to be tempered with the challenges of scale, quality and safety.
</p><p>With a frontier opening up like this, in some respects having the idea for a product is the easy part, it’s difficult not to see all of physical industry being impacted by synthetic biology in the near future, agriculture, textiles, construction, cosmetics, pharmaceuticals etc. etc.
</p><p>The challenge therefore is in the delivery, how is this particular group of people going to deliver the organism, enzyme, material, substrate into the relevant pipeline. Strategy is key, what is the best blend of capabilities to maintain in-house versus those that could be better supplied as part of an alliance or partnership, this optimisation gets particularly interesting when capital and expertise is constrained.
</p><p>Said challenges need to be considered for those investing in such endeavours, the founders themselves and outside investors; angels, venture capitalists or government funding. <span class='highlight'></span>We review synthetic biology business plans for any parties writing or reading such plans, with a weighting on delivery we adopt a qualitative approach attempting to reveal potential, critical issues, easy fixes and deal breakers</span>.

<h2>Primary section - Delivery</h2> 
</p><p><span class='subHeading'>Team:</span>  does the team have the know-how and experience to deliver, is external support available?
</p><p><span class='subHeading'></span>Offering:</span> What exactly is the end product?, problem being solved?
</p><p><span class='subHeading'>Milestones:</span>  what's the plan, specified actions with timeframes
</p><p><span class='subHeading'>Strategy:</span>  plugged into the ecosystem? employees, alliances, partnerships, outsourcing and customers
S</p><p><span class='subHeading'>Software, AI, Data, Automation:</span>  central to technologies of this complexity, do they have access to the tools required, the capacity to build them, are suitable third party tools available
</p><p><span class='subHeading'>Safety:</span>  is this relevant? If so, how is it going to be mitigated? What are the implications of failure in this aspect?
</div>

<div>
<h2>Secondary section - Fundamentals</h2> 
</p><p><span class='subHeading'></span>Science:</span> a review isn’t necessarily about validating the science, more ensuring the science is communicated effectively
</p><p><span class='subHeading'></span>Market:</span> can be easy when replacing incumbents but often times more challenging with disruptive novel applications
</p><p><span class='subHeading'></span>Economics:</span>, is this a genuine value proposition? are existing methods simply cheaper and easier?
</p><p><span class='subHeading'></span>Financials:</span> sense check on projections, costs, revenues, valuations
</p><p><span class='subHeading'></span>Competition:</span> there are some crowded peaks on the fitness landscape e.g. cannabinoids
