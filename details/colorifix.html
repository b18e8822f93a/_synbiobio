	<h1>Summary</h1><p>Developed an biological process that vastly reduced CO2, energy, water use and replaces the use of harmful chemicals used  to create colour and dye textiles.<br/><br/>Discover colours in nature.<br/><br/>Apply DNA sequencing to find the genes encoding pigment expression<br/><br/>Engineered microorganism are provided to clients who ferment on site the microorganism using natural feedstocks such as sugar, yeast, and plant-by-products. <br/><br/>Expressed dye is used directly in standard dye machines<br/><br/>Aim for economical competitiveness<br/><br/>The process works for dyeing both natural and synthetic fabrics, yarns, and garments.</p>
	<h1>Marketing</h1><p>Colorifix minimises the environmental impact of industrial dyeing by replacing chemistry with biology at every step in the process, from the creation of the dyes to their fixation into fabrics<br/><br/>The microorganisms are fuelled by simple sugars, yeast, and plant-by-products. What normally takes many petrochemicals, dyes are produced using these clean, renewable feedstocks.<br/><br/>The microorganisms divide every 20 minutes, resulting in a large quantity of colourful dye liquor within just one or two days.<br/><br/>This is then placed directly into standard dye machines, requiring no additional specialist equipment or toxic chemicals.<br/><br/>Three phases of testing internally to make sure it passes all critical industrial metrics, from performance on fabrics to biological safety and scalability.<br/></p>
	<h1>Safety</h1><p>Technology uses a GM process but not a GM product. <br/><br/>Risk class 1, containment level 1,  This class of GMO used  have been safely used in the pharmaceutical  industry for decades for example,  in the production of insulin. , food dyes, and other textile enzymes the industry is already familiar with.<br/><br/>Colorifix relies on a GM process to make a non-GM product, This is an important distinction from many GM applications such as cotton or food where the modified organism is the product. <br/><br/>The genetically engineered microorganism is used to produce a naturally-occurring pigment and leverage a basic biological process to transfer that colour onto textiles. <br/><br/>In the final stage of dyeing, we eliminate all live microorganisms through a validated inactivation step, resulting in a sterile, non-GM product.<br/></p>
	<h1>Sustainability</h1><p>The dyeing industry is one of the largest water consumers in the world, using over 5 trillion litres per year along, as well one of the most chemically intensive industries on earth it also one of the largest polluters of increasingly scarce freshwater.<br/><br/>The industry uses over 70 toxic chemicals in the dyeing process – these are contained in the dyes and the auxiliary chemicals that adhere the dyes to surfaces<br/><br/>Our dyes are produced, deposited and fixed onto fabrics without the need for heavy metals or organic solvents.<br/><br/>The engineered microorganisms, however, are able to concentrate the nutrient salts and metals that are already present in water to levels that facilitate this dye-fabric interaction with zero added substances.<br/><br/>Compared to the conventional dyeing step for cotton, the Colorifix technology reduces water consumption by at least 49%, electricity by 35%, and CO₂ emissions by 31%.<br/><br/>By localising production of the liquor at or near the dye house itself, transport costs and carbon emissions are further reduced<br/></p>
	<h1>Process</h1><p>The microbes grow on non-hazardous ingredients and could be agricultural by-products, which are naturally rich in sugars, peptides and salts.<br/><br/>Everything in the fermentor—the microbes, water and residual salts, and sugar — are then pumped into standard dye machines along with the yarn, fabric, or garment to be dyed.<br/><br/>Starting with the freeze-dried microbes, the customer can then grow hundreds to thousands of litres of colour producing microbes using precise fermentation.<br/><br/>The mill or dyehouse purchases and installs a bioreactor (300L or 3000L) on their site. Colorifix implementation team implements the technology and trains the staff, who are supported to grow the colour on-site via fermentation. <br/><br/>Patent-pending bioreactors are designed as plug-and-play units, afford simple installation, easy to clean-in-place, with robust air sterilisation and remote data storage/access.<br/><br/>Bacteria fixes itself straight onto the fabric to colour it,  the fabric is heated, causing the microorganisms’ membranes to burst and release the colour, which chemically attaches to the fibre. The remaining bacterial cells are then washed away, leaving the colour permanently fixed. <br/></p>
	<h1>Model</h1><p>Hybrid business model involves supplying hardware and media to dye houses, while also earning royalty revenues from mills that sell dyed products to fashion brands.</p>
